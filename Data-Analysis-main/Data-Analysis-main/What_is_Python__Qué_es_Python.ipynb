        "- Because the code is automatically compiled to byte code and executed, Python is suitable for use as a scripting language.\n",
        "- Python can be extend with others programming languages like C, C++, R, etc.. and that is perfect for intensive tasks\n",
        "- Because of its strong structuring constructs (nested code blocks, functions, classes, modules, and packages), ideal for shorts and large tasks \n",
        "- Python and the objects magic! Pythons provides a consistent way to use objects. In Python evrtyhing can be a object!\n",
